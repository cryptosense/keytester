                <p>
                Note that by submitting your key you agree to us keeping it in
                our database. We also ask for an email address so that we can
                send you the results. We may update you with new results later,
                for example when another key is submitted that shares a factor
                with yours. Unless you untick the checkbox, we may also send you
                information about other cryptosense products, for example as we
                add other factorization algorithms to the site. You can always
                opt-out later, and we will not communicate your address (or your
                key) to any other organization. For background information on
                RSA key factoring see
                <a href="https://cryptosense.com/an-online-rsa-key-tester/">our

                <h3 id="faq">FAQ</h3>

                <h4>1. What does batch-GCD do?</h4>

                <p>
                    The security of RSA relies on the fact that factoring the
                    public modulus of a key is computationally hard: for
                    example, if the modulus is of the form p.q, where p and q
                    are large primes, there is no known efficient algorithm for
                    obtaining the factorisation. But suppose that we have a
                    large number of keys available: we can try to compute the
                    pairwise GCDs of these moduli. If two of them happen to
                    share a common factor (that is, one is p.q and the other one
                    is p.q’), their GCD will be p and it will be possible to
                    factor these two keys, breaking security. Batch GCD applies
                    this technqiue to a large number of RSA moduli in an
                    efficient way.
                </p>

                <h4>2. How often are RSA keys vulnerable to this attack?</h4>

                <p>
                    Given "perfect" random number generators, the probability of
                    two large moduli sharing a prime is vanishingly small.
                    However, in practice, faulty random number generators often
                    lead to keys being vulnerable to this method of
                    cryptanalysis. In 2012, two large-scale surveys of
                    publically available RSA keys were carried out, resulting in
                    tens of thousands of keys being factored. The failure rate
                    of RSA keys was reported as 0.2% in Lenstra et al's work.
                </p>

                <h4>3. Can't I just do this test myself?</h4>

                <p>
                    Certainly you can, and there is plenty of information and
                    code around for doing it. However, for the test to be
                    meaningful you need to do it against a large database of
                    other RSA keys. That's what we've taken care of here at
                    Cryptosense - we will apply batch GCD against your key and
                    all the other keys in our (large) database.
                </p>

                <h4>4. I have a large number of keys generated by the same model
                    of embedded device, wouldn't it make sense to batch-GCD them
                    together rather than against your database?</h4>

                <p>
                    You should definitely do that. Even better would be to do
                    both. Get in touch if you need help to handle a large number
                    of keys.
                </p>

                <h4>5. What about invalid keys, typos etc.? </h4>

                <p>
                    Our web page includes a sanity check on the key: it tries to
                    divide it by the first few primes. If there is a parse error
                    or a factor is found, you will get a warning message and we
                    won't run batch GCD on your key.
                </p>

                <h4>6. How many keys are in your database?</h4>

                <p>
                    Several million, and growing. In particular, our database
                    includes TLS keys found on the internet and SSH keys found
                    on public websites.
                </p>

                <h4>7. This is awesome! How can I join your team?</h4>
